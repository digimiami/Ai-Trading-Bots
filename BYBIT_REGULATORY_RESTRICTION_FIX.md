# Bybit Regulatory Restriction Error (Code: 10024) - Fix

## Problem
The bot-executor function was encountering Bybit error code **10024** which indicates:
> "The product or service you are seeking to access is not available to you due to regulatory restrictions."

This error occurred for the **TESTNET RECOMMENDATIONS BTC** bot and caused trade execution failures.

## Error Details
- **Error Code:** 10024
- **Message:** Regulatory restrictions - account needs KYC verification or has access limitations
- **Impact:** Bots couldn't execute trades and marked them as failures

## Solution Applied

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling in `placeBybitOrder`
Added specific handling for error code 10024 in `supabase/functions/bot-executor/index.ts`:

```typescript
} else if (data.retCode === 10024) {
  // Regulatory restrictions - account needs KYC or has access restrictions
  console.warn(`‚ö†Ô∏è Regulatory restriction detected for ${symbol} trading`);
  console.warn(`üìã Error message: ${data.retMsg}`);
  console.warn(`üí° Action required: Complete KYC verification or contact Bybit Customer Support`);
  throw new Error(`Regulatory restriction: ${data.retMsg}. Please complete KYC verification on Bybit or contact Customer Support. Trading for this symbol will be skipped until the restriction is resolved.`);
}
```

### 2. Graceful Trade Skipping
Modified the `executeBot` catch block to handle regulatory restrictions gracefully:

- **Before:** Trade marked as failed/error
- **After:** Trade skipped with warning log, bot continues monitoring

When error code 10024 is detected:
- Logs a **warning** (not error) to bot activity
- Skips the trade gracefully
- Bot continues to monitor market conditions
- No false failure counts
- Clear user guidance in logs

## Required Actions

### For Users with Regulatory Restrictions:

1. **Complete KYC Verification on Bybit:**
   - Log into Bybit
   - Go to Account ‚Üí Verification
   - Complete the KYC (Know Your Customer) verification process
   - Wait for approval (usually 24-48 hours)

2. **Contact Bybit Customer Support** (if KYC is already complete):
   - Visit: https://www.bybit.com/en/help-center/s/webform
   - Explain that you're getting error code 10024
   - Request access to futures trading for your region

3. **Check Account Restrictions:**
   - Some regions have restrictions on certain trading pairs
   - Verify your account has access to the symbol you're trying to trade
   - Check if your account has futures trading enabled

## Current Bot Status

Based on the logs:
- ‚úÖ **4 bots executed successfully** (BTCUSDT trades placed)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **1 bot blocked by regulatory restrictions** (TESTNET RECOMMENDATIONS BTC)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **1 bot had insufficient balance** (SOLO REAL $$$ - short $3.47)

## Next Steps

1. **For TESTNET RECOMMENDATIONS BTC bot:**
   - Complete KYC verification on Bybit
   - Or use a different account that has regulatory access
   - The bot will automatically resume trading once the restriction is removed

2. **For SOLO REAL $$$ bot:**
   - Add at least $4 to your Bybit UNIFIED/Futures wallet
   - Current balance: $388.37
   - Required: $391.84 (order + 5% buffer)

## What Changed

**Before:**
- Regulatory restriction error caused trade to fail
- Bot marked as having errors
- Unclear error messages

**After:**
- Regulatory restriction handled gracefully
- Trade skipped with clear warning
- Bot continues monitoring
- User-friendly error messages
- Guidance on how to resolve the issue

## Technical Details

The fix ensures that:
1. Error code 10024 is specifically detected
2. A descriptive error message is generated
3. The trade is skipped (not failed)
4. A warning log is created for user awareness
5. The bot continues normal operation

The bot will retry on the next execution cycle, and if the restriction is resolved, trading will resume automatically.
