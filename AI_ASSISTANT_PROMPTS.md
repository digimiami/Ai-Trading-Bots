## Tips for Getting Better Responses

1. **Be Specific**: Instead of "help me with my bot", try "help me optimize my BTCUSDT RSI bot that's hitting stop loss too often"

2. **Provide Context**: Mention your risk tolerance, trading experience, or specific goals

3. **Ask Follow-ups**: If the answer isn't clear, ask for clarification or examples

4. **Use Action Words**: The AI can create bots for you - use phrases like "create", "set up", "make", or "build"

5. **Request Explanations**: Ask "why" and "how" to understand the reasoning behind recommendations
