Based on the logs you provided, here's what's preventing each bot from trading:

## üìä Summary

**Total Bots Executed:** 5  
**Bots Trading Successfully:** 0  
**Bots Blocked:** 5  

## üî¥ Blocking Issues

### 1. **Insufficient Balance** ‚ùå
**Bot:** "Ai Recommendations UNI" (UNIUSDT)  
**Issue:** Not enough funds in Bybit UNIFIED/Futures wallet

- **Available Balance:** $452.59
- **Required:** $787.07 (order: $749.59 + 5% buffer)
- **Shortfall:** $334.48

**Solution:**
```
Add at least $335 to your Bybit UNIFIED/Futures wallet
```

**Log Evidence:**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Insufficient balance: $452.59 < $787.07 (required + 5% buffer)
üí∞ Trade calculation: Base=$100 (min=$10), Leverage=5x, Risk=medium(1.5x) = Total=$750
üí° Tip: Add at least $335 to your Bybit UNIFIED/Futures wallet to enable trading
```

### 2. **Max Trades Per Day Reached** ‚è∏Ô∏è
**Bots:** 
- "ETH  $$$" (ETHUSDT)
- "SOLO REAL $$$" (SOLUSDT)  
- "ada real test" (ADAUSDT)

**Issue:** All three bots have reached their daily trading limit of 8 trades

**Log Evidence:**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Trading blocked for ETH  $$$: Max trades per day reached: 8/8. Trading paused until tomorrow.
‚ö†Ô∏è Trading blocked for SOLO REAL $$$: Max trades per day reached: 8/8. Trading paused until tomorrow.
‚ö†Ô∏è Trading blocked for ada real test: Max trades per day reached: 8/8. Trading paused until tomorrow.
```

**Solution:**
- Wait until tomorrow (midnight UTC) for the limit to reset
- OR increase the `max_trades_per_day` limit in bot settings
- OR manually reset the trade count (if you want to continue trading today)

### 3. **No Trading Signals Detected** ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Bot:** "pepe real" (PEPEUSDT)

**Issue:** Strategy evaluation found no trading signals (RSI/ADX conditions not met)

**Log Evidence:**
```
Strategy evaluation result: {
  "shouldTrade": false,
  "reason": "No trading signals detected",
  "confidence": 0
}
Trading conditions not met: No trading signals detected
Bot pepe real market data: Price=0, RSI=42.81, ADX=15.78
```

**Additional Issue:** Price is 0 for PEPEUSDT, indicating the symbol might not exist on Bybit linear futures

**Log Evidence:**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Bybit API error for PEPEUSDT (category=linear): Empty or invalid list { category: "", list: [] }
```

**Solution:**
1. **PEPEUSDT Symbol Issue:**
   - PEPEUSDT may not be available on Bybit linear futures
   - Try switching to spot trading, OR
   - Use a different symbol format (e.g., 1000PEPEUSDT), OR
   - Switch to a different exchange that supports PEPEUSDT

2. **No Trading Signals:**
   - Adjust strategy parameters (lower RSI threshold, lower ADX threshold)
   - Wait for better market conditions
   - This is normal - bots only trade when conditions are met

## ‚úÖ What's Working

1. **Bot Scheduler:** ‚úÖ Running successfully via PM2
   - All 5 bots are being executed every 5 minutes
   - No errors in the scheduler

2. **Safety Checks:** ‚úÖ Working correctly
   - Balance checks are preventing trades when funds are insufficient
   - Daily trade limits are being enforced
   - Bots are auto-paused when limits are reached

3. **Strategy Evaluation:** ‚úÖ Working correctly
   - Bots are evaluating market conditions
   - Only trading when signals are detected

## üîß Quick Fixes

### Fix 1: Add Funds for UNIUSDT Bot
1. Log into your Bybit account
2. Go to **Assets** ‚Üí **UNIFIED Account** (or **Futures**)
3. Transfer at least **$335 USDT** to the wallet
4. The bot will automatically retry on the next execution cycle

### Fix 2: Reset Daily Trade Limits (Optional)
If you want to continue trading today after reaching the limit:

**SQL Query to Reset:**
```sql
-- Reset trade counts for specific bots
UPDATE trading_bots 
SET last_trade_at = NULL
WHERE id IN (
  '6c325f80-0ac2-481c-9d91-f2332828a1b8', -- ETH $$$
  'c0cb75af-9ea0-4490-afdc-f59484827c3b', -- SOLO REAL $$$
  'ae1e4061-7d53-46ca-9de9-da10e407ed59'  -- ada real test
);
```

**OR Increase the Limit:**
```sql
UPDATE trading_bots 
SET max_trades_per_day = 20  -- Increase from 8 to 20
WHERE id IN (
  '6c325f80-0ac2-481c-9d91-f2332828a1b8',
  'c0cb75af-9ea0-4490-afdc-f59484827c3b',
  'ae1e4061-7d53-46ca-9de9-da10e407ed59'
);
```

### Fix 3: Fix PEPEUSDT Symbol Issue
1. Check if PEPEUSDT exists on Bybit:
   - Visit: https://www.bybit.com/trade/usdt/pepeusdt
   - If it doesn't exist, switch the bot to **spot trading** instead of futures

2. Update Bot Trading Type:
```sql
UPDATE trading_bots 
SET trading_type = 'spot'
WHERE id = '18651c6b-a5e2-493b-a978-005e97365463'; -- pepe real
```

OR use the UI to change the trading type from "Futures" to "Spot"

## üìà Expected Behavior After Fixes

1. **UNIUSDT Bot:** Will start trading once funds are added
2. **ETH/SOLO/ADA Bots:** Will resume trading tomorrow (or after limit reset)
3. **PEPEUSDT Bot:** Will work if symbol exists, or after switching to spot trading

---

## üîç How to Monitor

Check bot logs in Supabase:
```sql
SELECT 
  bot_id,
  level,
  category,
  message,
  created_at
FROM bot_logs
WHERE bot_id IN (
  '6c325f80-0ac2-481c-9d91-f2332828a1b8', -- ETH $$$
  'c0cb75af-9ea0-4490-afdc-f59484827c3b', -- SOLO REAL $$$
  'ae1e4061-7d53-46ca-9de9-da10e407ed59', -- ada real test
  'de0fc6ff-ddad-4934-b231-dbf949fe8805', -- Ai Recommendations UNI
  '18651c6b-a5e2-493b-a978-005e97365463'  -- pepe real
)
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 50;
```

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

**All bots are running correctly!** The issues are:
- ‚úÖ **Expected behavior** (safety limits working)
- ‚úÖ **Insufficient funds** (needs manual action)
- ‚úÖ **Daily limits reached** (will reset tomorrow)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Symbol/strategy issues** (may need configuration changes)

The bot executor is working perfectly - it's just enforcing safety limits and waiting for the right conditions! üöÄ
