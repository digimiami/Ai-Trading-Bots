# Fix Cron Job - Immediate Action Required

## Problem
Your cron job has a corrupted schedule entry:
```
log/bot-*/5 * * * * /var/www/Ai-Trading-Bots/scripts/call-bot-scheduler.sh
```

This is **invalid** and the cron job is not running! The logs stopped at 12:30:01.

## Fix Immediately

**On your server, run these commands:**

```bash
# 1. Edit the crontab
crontab -e

# 2. Find and fix the line - it should look like this:
*/5 * * * * /var/www/Ai-Trading-Bots/scripts/call-bot-scheduler.sh

# Remove the "log/bot-" part from the beginning!

# 3. Save and exit (in nano: Ctrl+X, then Y, then Enter)

# 4. Verify it's fixed
crontab -l

# Should show:
*/5 * * * * /var/www/Ai-Trading-Bots/scripts/call-bot-scheduler.sh

# 5. Wait 5 minutes and check logs again
tail -f /var/log/bot-scheduler/bot-scheduler.log
```

## Quick Fix (One Command)

If you want to fix it in one command:

```bash
# Remove the corrupted cron job
crontab -l | grep -v "log/bot" | crontab -

# Add the correct cron job
(crontab -l 2>/dev/null; echo "*/5 * * * * /var/www/Ai-Trading-Bots/scripts/call-bot-scheduler.sh") | crontab -

# Verify
crontab -l
```

## After Fixing

1. **Wait 5 minutes** - The cron job runs every 5 minutes
2. **Check logs:**
   ```bash
   tail -f /var/log/bot-scheduler/bot-scheduler.log
   ```
3. **You should see new entries** like:
   ```
   [2025-10-31 18:30:01] âœ… Bot scheduler called successfully (HTTP 200, X.XXXXXXs)
   "botsExecuted":4
   ```

## Why This Happened

The cron schedule got corrupted, possibly due to:
- Manual editing mistake
- Script deployment issue
- Copy/paste error

Once fixed, bots should start executing again!
