# üîß Fix: Bots Stop When Browser Closes

## **Problem Identified**

Your bots were stopping when you close the browser because **client-side code** was executing them using `setInterval` in the browser. When the browser closes, JavaScript execution stops, so the intervals are cleared.

---

## **‚úÖ Solution: Server-Side Execution**

We've already set up **server-side cron job execution** that runs 24/7, independent of your browser. However, the client-side code was still running and conflicting.

---

## **üõ†Ô∏è Fix Applied**

### **1. Disabled Client-Side Auto-Execution**

**File**: `src/hooks/useBotExecutor.ts`

**Changed**:
- ‚ùå **Removed**: Client-side `setInterval` that executed bots every 5 minutes
- ‚úÖ **Kept**: Manual execution functions (for testing/debugging)
- ‚úÖ **Kept**: Time sync (for UI display only)

**Result**: Bots are **no longer executed from the browser**.

---

## **‚úÖ Verify Server-Side Cron is Running**

Your bots should now run from the **server-side cron job** that we set up earlier. Verify it's running:

### **Check Cron Job Status**

SSH into your server and run:

```bash
# Check if cron job is installed
crontab -l

# Should show:
# */5 * * * * /var/www/Ai-Trading-Bots/scripts/call-bot-scheduler.sh

# Check recent logs
tail -f /var/log/bot-scheduler/bot-scheduler.log

# Should show recent execution logs like:
# [2025-10-31 XX:XX:XX] ‚úÖ Bot scheduler called successfully (HTTP 200, X.XXs)
```

### **If Cron Job is NOT Running**

If the cron job isn't set up yet, follow these steps:

```bash
# 1. Go to your project directory
cd /var/www/Ai-Trading-Bots

# 2. Make sure .env.cron exists and has correct values
cat .env.cron

# Should contain:
# SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
# SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
# CRON_SECRET=your-cron-secret

# 3. Run the deployment script
bash scripts/deploy-cron.sh

# 4. Test the cron script manually
bash scripts/call-bot-scheduler.sh

# Should show: ‚úÖ Bot scheduler called successfully
```

## **üìã How It Works Now**

### **Before (Broken):**
```
Browser ‚Üí setInterval ‚Üí Execute Bots
         ‚Üì
    Browser closes ‚Üí Execution stops ‚ùå
```

### **After (Fixed):**
```
Server Cron ‚Üí Every 5 minutes ‚Üí bot-scheduler ‚Üí bot-executor ‚Üí Execute Bots
                                                              ‚Üì
                                                        24/7 Execution ‚úÖ
Browser ‚Üí Only for UI/Manual Testing
         (Doesn't affect trading)
```

---

## **üß™ Testing**

1. **Close your browser completely**
2. **Wait 5-10 minutes**
3. **Check Supabase logs**:
   - Go to Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Edge Functions ‚Üí `bot-executor` ‚Üí Logs
   - You should see execution logs even after browser is closed
4. **Check server logs** (if you have SSH access):
   ```bash
   tail -f /var/log/bot-scheduler/bot-scheduler.log
   ```

---

## **üö® Important Notes**

### **1. Browser is NOT Required**
- ‚úÖ Bots run 24/7 from server
- ‚úÖ Browser is only for viewing/configuration
- ‚úÖ You can close browser anytime

### **2. Server Must Stay Running**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Your **server** must be running for cron to work
- ‚ö†Ô∏è If your server is a VPS/cloud instance, it should run 24/7
- ‚ö†Ô∏è If using local development machine, it must stay on

### **3. Manual Execution Still Works**
- ‚úÖ You can still manually trigger bots from the UI
- ‚úÖ This is useful for testing
- ‚úÖ Manual execution doesn't interfere with cron

---

## **üìä Verify It's Working**

### **Method 1: Check Supabase Logs**

1. Open **Supabase Dashboard**
2. Go to **Edge Functions** ‚Üí **`bot-executor`** ‚Üí **Logs**
3. You should see logs every ~5 minutes
4. Check timestamps - they should continue even after closing browser

### **Method 2: Check Database**

```sql
-- Check recent trade activity
SELECT 
  id,
  bot_id,
  symbol,
  side,
  status,
  executed_at,
  created_at
FROM trades
WHERE executed_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
ORDER BY executed_at DESC;

-- Should show trades even after browser is closed
```

### **Method 3: Check Bot Status**

```sql
-- Check if bots are still running
SELECT 
  id,
  name,
  status,
  updated_at,
  last_execution_at
FROM trading_bots
WHERE status = 'running';

-- updated_at should update every ~5 minutes
```

## **üîç Troubleshooting**

### **Issue: Bots Still Stop When Browser Closes**

**Possible Causes:**

1. **Cron job not installed**
   ```bash
   crontab -l
   # If empty, run: bash scripts/deploy-cron.sh
   ```

2. **Cron script failing**
   ```bash
   # Test manually
   bash scripts/call-bot-scheduler.sh
   # Check for errors
   ```

3. **Server is down/offline**
   - Check if your server is running
   - Check server uptime: `uptime`

4. **Wrong deployment**
   - Make sure latest code is deployed: `git pull`
   - Make sure `.env.cron` has correct values

### **Issue: Multiple Executions (Double Trading)**

If you see bots executing twice, it means:
- ‚úÖ Cron is working (good!)
- ‚ùå Client-side code might still be running

**Fix**: Make sure you deployed the updated `useBotExecutor.ts` with client-side execution disabled.

---

## **üìù Summary**

- ‚úÖ **Fixed**: Client-side auto-execution disabled
- ‚úÖ **Solution**: Server-side cron job handles execution
- ‚úÖ **Result**: Bots run 24/7 even when browser is closed
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Requirement**: Server must stay running

---

## **üÜò Need Help?**

If bots still stop when browser closes:

1. Check cron job: `crontab -l`
2. Check logs: `tail -f /var/log/bot-scheduler/bot-scheduler.log`
3. Test manually: `bash scripts/call-bot-scheduler.sh`
4. Check Supabase Edge Function logs for execution history

**Your bots should now run 24/7! üöÄ**
