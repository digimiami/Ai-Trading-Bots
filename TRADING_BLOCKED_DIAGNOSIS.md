# 🛑 Why Bot Stopped Trading - Diagnosis Guide

## **Current Issue Analysis**

Based on the logs, here's why trading is blocked:

---

## **🔴 Primary Issue: Insufficient Balance**

### **Problem**
Your Bybit account has **$0.00** available balance, but orders require:
- **SOLUSDT**: $372.62 (needs $391.25 with 5% buffer)
- **ETHUSDT**: $346.19 (needs $363.49 with 5% buffer)

### **What's Happening**
1. ✅ Bot detects trading signal (RSI oversold/overbought)
2. ✅ Bot calculates order size ($375 with 5x leverage)
3. ✅ Bot checks balance **BEFORE** placing order
4. ❌ Balance check fails: $0.00 < Required
5. ⚠️ Trade is **blocked** to prevent API errors

### **Solution**
**Add funds to your Bybit account:**
1. Log into Bybit → **Wallet** → **Futures** (UNIFIED account)
2. Transfer USDT to your futures wallet
3. **Minimum needed**: ~$400 USDT (to cover orders + buffer)
4. **Recommended**: $500+ USDT for safety

---

## **✅ What's Working Correctly**

1. **Balance Check System** ✅
   - Checking balance before orders
   - Preventing wasted API calls
   - Logging clear error messages

2. **Strategy Evaluation** ✅
   - Detecting RSI signals correctly
   - Strategy evaluation working
   - Trade signals being generated

3. **Safety Features** ✅
   - Trade count is now correct (0/8 today)
   - Safety limits working
   - Bot execution running smoothly

## **🔍 Other Issues Found**

### **1. Strategy Parsing Issue (Non-Critical)**
The strategy field is being logged character-by-character, suggesting possible double-encoding.

**Status**: Fixed in code (handles double-encoding)
**Impact**: Strategy still works, just logging looks weird

---

## **📊 Log Analysis**

### **Successful Operations:**
- ✅ Bot execution starting
- ✅ Market data fetching
- ✅ Strategy evaluation working
- ✅ Safety checks passing
- ✅ Balance checks working (detecting $0.00)

### **Blocked Operations:**
- ❌ Trade execution (insufficient balance)

## **🚀 How to Fix**

### **Step 1: Add Funds to Bybit**

1. **Go to Bybit** → https://www.bybit.com
2. **Login** to your account
3. **Navigate to**: Wallet → **Futures** (or UNIFIED)
4. **Deposit/Transfer** at least **$400-500 USDT**

### **Step 2: Verify Balance**

After adding funds, check:
- **Available Balance** should show USDT
- **Wallet Type**: UNIFIED (for futures trading)

### **Step 3: Monitor Logs**

After adding funds, you should see:
```
💰 Balance check for SOLUSDT buy: Available=$XXX.XX, Required=$372.62
✅ Sufficient balance: $XXX.XX >= $391.25 (required + 5% buffer)
```

Instead of:
```
⚠️ Insufficient balance: $0.00 < $391.25
```

## **💡 Why Balance Shows $0.00**

Possible reasons:
1. **No funds deposited** to Bybit account
2. **Funds in wrong wallet** (Spot vs Futures)
3. **Funds locked** in open positions
4. **API key permissions** issue (check API permissions)
5. **Testnet vs Mainnet** mismatch

### **Check Your Bybit Account:**

```sql
-- Run this SQL to verify bot configuration
SELECT 
  id,
  name,
  exchange,
  symbol,
  (SELECT api_key FROM api_keys WHERE user_id = trading_bots.user_id AND exchange = trading_bots.exchange LIMIT 1) as has_api_key,
  (SELECT is_testnet FROM api_keys WHERE user_id = trading_bots.user_id AND exchange = trading_bots.exchange LIMIT 1) as is_testnet
FROM trading_bots
WHERE status = 'running';
```
