# Trading Bot Configuration Guide

## Understanding Spot vs Futures Trading

### **Spot Trading**
- **Buy Only:** You can only BUY assets using your USDT balance
- **Cannot Sell:** You cannot sell assets you don't own
- **Example:** With 8,929 USDT, you can:
  - ‚úÖ BUY BTC with USDT
  - ‚úÖ BUY ETH with USDT
  - ‚úÖ BUY DOT with USDT
  - ‚ùå SELL BTC (unless you own BTC)
  - ‚ùå SELL ETH (unless you own ETH)

### **Futures Trading (Perpetual/Linear)**
- **Buy (Long):** Open a long position (bet price goes up)
- **Sell (Short):** Open a short position (bet price goes down)
- **With 8,929 USDT:** You can open both long AND short positions
- **Risk Management:** Automatic SL/TP applied:
  - Stop Loss: 2% from entry
  - Take Profit: 3% from entry
